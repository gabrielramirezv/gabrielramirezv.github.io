## About me  

I am an undergraduate student in <a href="https://www.lcg.unam.mx/">
<span style="color: green;">Genomic Sciences</span></a> at the <a 
href="https://www.unam.mx/"><span style="color: green;">National Autonomous 
University of Mexico (UNAM)</span></a>. I am interested in immunology, viruses 
and bioinformatics.  

Currently, I am doing research about erythrocytes differentiation at <a href="https://www.ibt.unam.mx/perfil/3283/dra-yvonne-jane-rosenstein-azoulay"><span style="color: green;">Dr. Yvonne 
Rosenstein</span></a>'s lab. We are studying the process by which erythrocytes precursors lose their nucleus to become mature red blood cells. I am so excited to see what can we learn of this!  

Also, I am a former missionary for <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/"><span style="color: green;">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</span></a>. During my full-time mission, I learned to serve others and to strive to be a better person. I also developed many life skills, such as leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving.  

Apart from my academic and personal life, I enjoy practicing Mexican folklore dance, swimming, and spending time with my family and friends. I also like to read and learn about new topics.   

## Key Skills

- **Adaptability**: I have learned to adapt to new situations and environments, which has helped me to grow and develop as a person.  

## Technical Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, Bash  
- **Bioinformatics Tools**: BLAST, MUSCLE, Clustal Omega, etc.  
- **Languages**: Spanish (Native), English (B1), French (A2)
