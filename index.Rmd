## Research Interests  

I am an undergraduate student in [Genomic Sciences](https://www.lcg.unam.mx/) at the [National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM)](https://www.unam.mx/).  
My main interests include:  

- **Immunology** and host–virus interactions  
- **Erythropoiesis** and red blood cell development  
- **Bioinformatics & Genomics**, especially RNA-seq and computational analysis  

I aim to integrate experimental biology with computational approaches to better understand how cellular and viral processes are regulated at the molecular level.
